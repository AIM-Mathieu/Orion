# Orion
Orion is a machine learning library built for sensor data collected from Satellites. The library makes use of a number of automated machine learning tools developed under ["The human data interaction project"](https://github.com/HDI-Project)  within the [Data to AI Lab at MIT](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/). The focus, with the ready availability of automated machine leanring is on:

* domain expert interaction with the machine learning system
* learning from minimal labels
* explainability of model outputs
* model audit
* scalability

# Install

To install the project, after cloning the repository and creating a virtualenv, execute

```
make install-develop
```

# Command Line Interface usage example

In the following example we load the `S-1` signal from NASA data,
execute the `lstm_dynamic_threshold` pipeline on it and store the
found anomalies inside the `output/S-1.anomalies.csv` file:

```
$ orion -v -p orion/pipelines/lstm_dynamic_threshold.json S-1
